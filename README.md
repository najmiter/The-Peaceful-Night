# The Peaceful Night
One of the projects I did when I thought I wanted to be a Web Developer 🙃

It uses only `CSS` for all kinds of imagery in the scene. There's mountains 🏔️, stars 🌟, a planet 🌍, and the sun ☀️. All of that is created using pure `CSS`.

Like any other code here (unless otherwise specified), you can use it anywhere you like.
